# A Simple Java-built Calculator
My first project on Github. The objective here is to build a calculator using MVC architecture

I worked with the NetBeans IDE, and with JavaFX for implementing the GUI.

## Progression : 
This version is a very simple calculator, no memory cache, no complex calculations, just operations one after the other.

## Project shortcomings :
- Not Able to write "-x"
- Can't return previous operation's result after clicking on another operator
- Must always clean the result if there's an error) before beginning another operation
-

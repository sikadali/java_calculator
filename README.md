# A Simple Java-built Calculator
My first project on Github. The objective here is to build a calculator using MVC architecture

I worked with the NetBeans IDE, and with JavaFX for implementing the GUI.

## Progression : 
This first version is a very simple calculator, no memory cache, no complex calculations, just operations one after the other.

## What's next :
- Returns "ERROR" when a number is divided by 0
- Add ".", for inputing double numbers
- Add others operators : "1/x", "sqrt", "%", "power(?)"
- For now there's a result only after clicking on "equals"; It need to return previous operation's result after clicking on another operator

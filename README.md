# A Simple Java-built Calculator
My first project on Github. The objective here is to build a calculator using MVC architecture

I worked with the NetBeans IDE, and with JavaFX for implementing the GUI.
This first version is a very simple calculator, no memory cache, no complex calculations, just operations one after the other.
